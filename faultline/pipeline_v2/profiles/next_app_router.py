"""Next.js App Router :class:`FrameworkProfile` — the ONE module per stack.

This is the engine's deep, deterministic understanding of how a Next.js
App Router repository assembles files into user-facing capabilities. It
encodes the *framework convention* (valid for ANY App Router repo), not
any corpus repo's paths — see CLAUDE.md ``rule-no-repo-specific-paths``
and ``rule-no-magic-tuning``. All knowledge lives here + one entry-point
line in pyproject.toml (OCP); the core never changes.

Structural model encoded (from the official Next.js docs,
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure —
NEVER a repo README, per ``rule-no-readme``):

  * The App Router lives under ``app/`` or ``src/app/`` (the ``src/``
    folder is an optional application-source root).
  * **Routing files** make a segment public:
      - ``page.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}``       → a page (PAGE)
      - ``route.{js,ts}``              → an API endpoint (API)
      - ``layout`` / ``template`` / ``loading`` / ``error`` /
        ``not-found`` / ``global-error`` / ``default``  → route-scaffold
        UI (PAGE — they belong to their segment's feature)
  * **Folders define URL segments.** The first *meaningful* segment under
    ``app/`` is the capability the file serves. Skipped, because they
    are NOT URL segments:
      - route groups ``(marketing)``    — organisational only
      - private folders ``_components``  — opted out of routing
      - parallel-route slots ``@modal``  — named slots
      - intercepting routes ``(.)``/``(..)``/``(...)`` — overlay markers
      - dynamic segments ``[id]`` / ``[...slug]`` / ``[[...slug]]`` — params
  * **Colocation:** components / hooks / lib / actions colocated under a
    route segment belong to that segment's feature. ``app/api/**/route.ts``
    is the API surface.
  * **Server Actions** (``"use server"`` files / functions) are mutation
    flow entries.
  * Shared UI / hooks / utils (``components/``, ``hooks/``, ``lib/``)
    are genuinely cross-cutting and must FAN OUT (blast-radius), never
    collapse a route feature into a physical-container blob.

Alignment contract (critical — see the architect's wiring notes):

  ``feature_of`` returns the SAME kebab slug the
  :class:`~faultline.pipeline_v2.extractors.route.RouteFileExtractor`
  surfaces (``slugify`` of the first meaningful segment under ``app/``),
  because the Stage-2 wiring only RE-HOMES a path to a feature whose name
  already exists — it never invents a feature. We therefore reuse the
  extractor's own ``slugify`` / ``is_noise`` helpers so the names match
  byte-for-byte.

Deterministic — NO LLM, NO network. Universal — no corpus paths, no
tuned magic numbers (the one structural cap is justified inline).

# are ecosystem-standard (feature-sliced-design, the Next "modules"
# pattern, the bulletproof-react "features" pattern). A path
# ``modules/billing/...`` / ``features/billing/...`` declares ``billing``
# as a capability exactly the way ``app/billing/...`` does. We treat the

# boundary. Universal convention names — NOT any repo's paths.

# the boundary fires only when the existing route/module evidence is
# absent (see ``_owning_boundary``'s precedence).

            ``app/`` (a route group owns it only when no real child segment
            follows). This is leaf-CONSERVATIVE: distinct named segments
            are distinct capabilities, so a SAML handler under ``auth/saml``
            or a Slack installer under ``integrations/slack`` keeps its own
            segment key instead of folding up into ``auth`` /
            ``integrations`` (which would erase the capability and blob the
            ancestor);
          * a modular-layout file → its ``modules/<d>`` / ``features/<d>``
            domain.

        By the re-home contract a path is re-homed only when this name
        EXISTS in the working feature set — either because an extractor

        re-home → the LLM's richer name survives (None-equivalent). Net:
        multi-file capability folders are pulled off the workspace anchor
        (blob killed) while one-off deep segments keep their rich names.

        Files NOT under any capability boundary (root ``app/layout.tsx``,
        top-level shared ``components/`` / ``lib/`` / ``hooks/``) return
        ``None`` so they fall through to the generic residual / fan-out
