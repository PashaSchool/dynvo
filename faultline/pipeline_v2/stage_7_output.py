"""Stage 7 — output assembly.

Builds the final :class:`FeatureMap` from the Stage 6 enriched
:class:`Feature` list, attaches ``scan_meta`` telemetry, and persists
it via the existing :func:`faultline.output.writer.write_feature_map`.

The pipeline-v2 output is intentionally compatible with the legacy
on-disk schema:

  - ``features`` keeps every developer feature (back-compat with the
    landing app, replay registry, cloud sync, incremental loader).
  - ``developer_features`` / ``product_features`` are re-derived on
    ``model_dump`` so v2 consumers can read the layered shape directly.
  - ``product_features`` is always empty for Layer 1 (Layer 2 is
    deferred per the rebuild plan).
  - ``scan_meta`` carries stage timings, stack/monorepo detection,
    LLM fallback share, model id, and any warnings the pipeline
    collected.

Per-stage artifact logging
==========================

Each stage can call :func:`write_stage_artifact` to drop a single JSON
snapshot of its output into ``~/.faultline/logs/<slug>/NN-stage-<name>.json``.
This is debug-only — the orchestrator wires it from the outside so
individual stages stay pure.
